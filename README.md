🌱 I am a Ph.D student in National University of Singapore  

👀 I am currently working on  
  1) Developing tactile sensors using Origami and Kirigami design principles  
  2) Integrating close-range battery-less RF communication for tactile sensors  

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on use of AI and ML in sensor characterisation and application development
